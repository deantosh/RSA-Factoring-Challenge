Prime factorization forms the basis of how network is secured using i.e RSA
factoring solution

We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt
very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated
using large enough prime numbers. Your mission should you choose to accept it,
is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this
bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.

Tasks
-----
-----
    01. Factorize all numbers (simple task)
    02. Prime factorization of the numbers (advanced -- getting prime factors)
